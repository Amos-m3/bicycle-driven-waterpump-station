# bicycle-driven-waterpump-station
this repository is to co-develop an open-source hardware bicycle-driven waterpump station
## requirements
- design and development of longer lasting, more durable water pump station for rural communities without electricity access

##  Ideas
- change of pump actuator 
- Using of mechanical bicycle drive instead of hand pump
  - convert rotation from bicycle to mechanical power for pumping water
  - or convert to electrical power as alternative for solarpanel generation (lower invest for electrical system)


## Need
- research on existing projects
- Design concept
- Possible description for student project work (like bachelor/ master thesis)

## licensing

## Existing concepts
Appropedia
- [water pump chapter] (https://www.appropedia.org/Water_pumps)
- Hydraulic ram pump: [https://www.appropedia.org/Hydraulic_ram_pumps]
